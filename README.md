# Analyze Impact of TKDD Budget Allocation on Community Welfare

uncover how Indonesia’s regional budget allocations (TKDD) impact real human development

- Massive Budget, Uneven Impact
Every year, billions in TKDD are allocated to regions—but absorption and outcomes vary drastically.
- Absorption ≠ Success
High budget absorption often masks poor planning and negligible impact on human development.
- Misaligned Priorities
Infrastructure spending dominates, yet fails to directly improve education, health, or purchasing power—core components of HDI.
- Wrong Metrics, Wrong Incentives
Budget allocations still favor geography over performance. Regions with low HDI often receive less, perpetuating inequality.
- Python-Powered Accountability
This project uses Python to analyze TKDD absorption, correlate it with HDI, and uncover patterns that reveal inefficiencies.
- Policy-Driven Insights
Recommends shifting focus from input-based metrics to outcome-based planning—where real progress matters more than budget execution.
